Reflect implements an interface change to the comments section that helps people listen, while at the same 
time producing useful summaries. Instead of a single column of threads, two side-by-side columns are provided. The first column contains 
the original raw comments that we all know and love. The second column has a list of concise summary bullet points for each respective 
comment. Other readers and discussants add these bullet points. Commenters can engage with summarizers to make sure that the summarized 
points accurately portray the points they were trying to make. Adding a summary bullet point is an act of listening somewhere between 
clicking the "I like this comment" button and responding to a comment.

== Installing Reflect into Slashcode ==

Create a Reflect directory in your Slashcode plugin directory and clone this repo. 

	git clone git@github.com:tkriplean/Slash-Reflect-sandbox.git /path/to/slashcode/plugins/Reflect

Run the installer. Make sure to select the Reflect and Ajax plugins. 

Need to add something like the following at an appropriate place in themes/templates/html-header:

	[% IF constants.plugin.Reflect %]
		<script src="/js/third_party/inheritance.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		<script src="/js/third_party/json2.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		<script src="/js/third_party/jquery.highlight.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		<script src="/js/third_party/jquery.jqote2.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		<script src="/js/third_party/jquery.noblecount.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		<script src="/js/reflect.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		<script src="/js/reflect.slash.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
	[% END %]

Make sure to run /path/to/slashcode/bin/symlink-tool.

Depending on the theme you are using, you may have to modify some of the settings in /js/reflect.slash.js.
